# Green's Function and ODE with IVP
# By: Connor Seimears

## Purpose of Program

The purpose of the program is to take the assigned ODE's:

𝑦" + 2𝑦′ + 2 = 2𝑥; 𝑡 ≥ 0; 𝑦(0) = 𝑦′(0) = 0

𝑦" + 𝑦 = 4; 𝑡 ≥ 0; 𝑦(0) = 𝑦′(0) = 0

Solve for their homogeneous solutions, and use Green's function.
Then, plot both the homogeneous solutions and Greens's function 
solutions for each ODE. 

## Requirements

In order to run the program, the following need to be installed 
on your computer: Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

## Running the Program

After the requirements are installed, simply type in the terminal:

'python GreensFuncProj.py'

## Notes

I have noticed that on my machine (Macbook Air 2017), the program 
can take kind of long to display the graphs/plots. However, I can
assure you that they will eventually show up :)
